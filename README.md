# :ballot_box: Dump MongoDB Database

It's a simple script made with PowerShell to create a backup of a MongoDB database and save all collections in a `.zip` folder or `.gz` file.

## :arrows_clockwise: Creating a simple backup flow

__1.__ Verify the version of MongoDB, running:
```powershell
mongod --version
```

__2.__ If the version of your MongoDB is 4.4 or above, you will need to install de _mongodump, mongorestore_, and other tools separately. For this, follow this guide: [Installing the Database Tools on Windows](https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools/installation/installation-windows/)
> [!NOTE]
> "Starting with MongoDB 4.4, the MongoDB Database Tools are now released separately from the MongoDB Server..."

__3.__ After the installation or if your version already has the database tools (like in version 4.2), run the following commands to guarantee that the tools are accessible by the command line:
```powershell
mongodump --help
```
```powershell
mongorestore --help
```
> [!NOTE]
> If they are not accessible, follow this guide: [Make the DB Tools available in your PATH](https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools/installation/installation-windows/#make-the-db-tools-available-in-your-path)

__4.__ After all the process of installation/verification we will create the flow properly

  __4.1__ Edit the [backupMongoDatabase.ps1](./backupMongoDatabase.ps1) script, modifying the variables:
  ```powershell
  $databaseName = "databaseName"
  $mongoDbHost = "localhost:27017"
  $backupPath = "C:\Path\To\Back\Folder"
  ```
  > [!NOTE]
  > If the database requires authorization remember to use the command with __-u__ and __-p__ flags
  
  __4.2.__ Edit the [createSystemScheduledTask.ps1](./createSystemScheduledTask.ps1) script, modifying the  variable with the path of the [backupMongoDatabase](./backupMongoDatabase.ps1) script and the time that the task will run
   ```powershell
  $scriptToExecutePath = "C:\Path\To\backupMongoDatabase.ps1"
  $trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 1am
  ```
  > [!NOTE]
  > Change the 'databaseName' in the name and description too, for more control of which database that task will back up
  
  __4.3.__ Finally, open the PowerShell as admin (for precaution) and enter in the folder that the ___createSystemScheduledTask.ps1___ is
  ```powershell
  cd "C:\Path\To\WhereScriptIs"
  ```
  
  __4.4.__ And execute it
  ```powershell
  ./createSystemScheduledTask.ps1
  ```
  
  __4.5.__ The following output will be shown
  <br/>
  <img src="./docs/task-created.png" />
  
__5.__ :white_check_mark: Success! We created a basic backup task. You can check the task in _Task Scheduler_ too:
<img width="480px" src="./docs/search-task-scheduler.png" />
<br/><br/>
The task:
<img src="./docs/task-in-task-scheduler.png" />

__6.__ Test if the task is running correctly executing it manually:
```powershell
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'MongoDB Backup - <databaseName>'
```
